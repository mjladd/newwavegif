I use a combination of KeepVid as well as Gif Brewery to make my gifs. Have I messed with the automated making of gifs? Yes, I can't get it to work like I can get it to work by hand. Basic rule of thumbs when making gifs are these.

## Wall of Voodoo

- Overview
    - Wall of Voodoo was an American new wave group from Los Angeles best known for the 1983 hit "Mexican Radio". The band had a sound that was a fusion of synthesizer-based new wave music with the spaghetti western soundtrack style of Ennio Morricone. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_Voodoo). And as a bit of personal trivia Stan Ridgeway (vocalist and harmonica player) paired with Stewart Copeland of The Police to make 'Don't Box Me In' for the Francis Ford Coppola film 'Rumblefish' based on the S.E. Hinton Novel of the same name.
