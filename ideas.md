I use a combination of KeepVid as well as Gif Brewery to make my gifs. Have I messed with the automated making of gifs? Yes, I can't get it to work like I can get it to work by hand. Basic rule of thumbs when making gifs are these.

## Split Enz

- Overview
    - Neil Finn is possibly best known for his work in Crowded House. And while Crowded House was certainly channelling and straddling the genre and time period of New Wave, they don't make the cut. Split Enz, however, do make the cut. Operating from 1972 - 1984, Split Enz by the end of their tenure were the epitome of what New Wave music came to be. The 1980 single "I Got You" was a #1 hit in their native Austrailia. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split_Enz).

## Stewart Copeland

- Overview
    - Stewart Copeland is best known as the drummer for The Police. His reggae infused back beats were like the rug in the Big Lebowski, it really tied the room together for The Police. In 1983, Francis Ford Coppola asked Copeland if he would assist in the development of the soundtrack for the film "Rumblefish" based on the S.E. Hinton novel of the same name. Copeland agreed and both the film and soundtrack are a hidden gem of the New Wave 80's.

## Wall of Voodoo

- Overview
    - Wall of Voodoo was an American new wave group from Los Angeles best known for the 1983 hit "Mexican Radio". The band had a sound that was a fusion of synthesizer-based new wave music with the spaghetti western soundtrack style of Ennio Morricone. [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall_of_Voodoo). And as a bit of personal trivia Stan Ridgeway (vocalist and harmonica player) paired with Stewart Copeland of The Police to make 'Don't Box Me In' for the Francis Ford Coppola film 'Rumblefish' based on the S.E. Hinton Novel of the same name.
